# AutoFox_INA226
A C++ library for using the INA226 Voltage, current and power measurement chip from Texas Instruments

For Arduino (and soon STM32 using CubeMX & Atollic TrueStudio).

There are a number of low cost breakout boards for the INA226 (similar to the INA219) available from sites such as Aliexpress.  None of the libraries that I found were complete enough for my needs so I wrote this one.

I'll write up a more complete readme and tutorial when I get the time.
